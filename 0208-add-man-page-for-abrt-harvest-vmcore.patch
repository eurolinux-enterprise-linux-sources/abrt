+NAME
+----
+abrt-harvest-vmcore - Converts VMCores to ABRT problems
+
+SYNOPSIS
+--------
+'abrt-harvest-vmcore'
+
+DESCRIPTION
+-----------
+This script is meant to be run once at system startup after abrtd is up and
+running. It moves all vmcore directories in /var/crash (which are presumably
+created by kdump) to abrtd spool directory.
+
+The goal is to let abrtd notice and process them as new problem data dirs.
+
+FILES

+   problem directory
