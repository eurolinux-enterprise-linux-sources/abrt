============

NAME
----
abrt.conf - Configuration file for abrt.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
'abrt' is a daemon that watches for application crashes. When a crash occurs, it
collects the problem data and takes action according to its configuration. This
document describes abrt's configuration file.

The configuration file consists of items in the format "Option = Value".
A description of each item follows:

DumpLocation = 'directory'::
   The directory where should 'abrt' store coredumps and all files which are
   needed for reporting. The default is /var/spool/abrt.

MaxCrashReportsSize = 'number'::
   The maximum disk space (specified in megabytes) that 'abrt'
   will use for all the crash dumps. Specify a value here to ensure
   that the crash dumps will not fill all available storage space.
   The default is 1000.

WatchCrashdumpArchiveDir = 'directory'::
   The daemon will watch this directory and call 'abrt-handle-upload' on files
   which appear there. This is used to auto-unpack crashdump tarballs uploaded
   via ftp, scp, etc. The directory must exist and be writable for 'abrt'.
   There is no default.
